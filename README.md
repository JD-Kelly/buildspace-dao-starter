# buildspace x thirdweb - Build your own DAO with just Javascript

### Exploring the world of Web3 one project at a time via the wonderful [buildspace.so](https://buildspace.so/)

### Find the project running on Netlify, here [DebugDAO](https://unruffled-kepler-095ad0.netlify.app/)

# What is it?
The idea behind this project was to build a StackOverflow clone but with a focus on DAO princinples. Essentially members would be able to receive DAO tokens in exchange for their coding knowledge to help with answering questions submitted by other members.

In its current form it only lets users connect their wallet, mint their membership NFT and vote on proposals. Adding the ability for users to submit questions and answers will be in a future iteration.  

# What's it built with?
